TRUNCATE:
It is a DDL command
It does not support WHERE clause/condition
Removes all the data all the time
Faster than DELETE as it locks entire table
It removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the tableâ€™s data, and only the page deallocations are recorded in the transaction log
It does not activate triggers
Table identity column is reset to seed value


DELETE:
It is DML command
It supports WHERE clause/condition
Removes data based on conditions specified in the WHERE clause (removes all the data if there is no WHERE clause)
Slower than TRUNCATE as it takes row level locks
It removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row
It does activate triggers
Table identity column is not reset
